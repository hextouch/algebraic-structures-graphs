# Algebraic Structures & Graphs

This repository provides a unified foundation in graph theory, combinatorics, group theory, and their applications in AI, physics, and network science.

## Topics Covered

- **Graph Theory & Combinatorics**
	- Graphs, adjacency matrices, Laplacians
	- Random walks, spectral graph theory
	- Applications: GNNs, network science, social dynamics
- **Group Theory, Symmetry & Invariances**
	- Groups, rings, fields basics
	- Lie groups & Lie algebras
	- Symmetry in physics & equivariant neural networks

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains a README and Python scripts illustrating key concepts and algorithms. Example code uses `numpy`, `networkx`, and other scientific libraries.

## Getting Started

To run the example scripts, ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx
```

Then run any script, for example:

```bash
python graph-theory/adjacency_matrix_example.py
```
